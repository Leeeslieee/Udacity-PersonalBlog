                <p><strong class="primary-green">During</strong> summer, it is the watermelon season. I especially like seedless watermelon
                    since you won't feel the texture of the seeds when you are enjoying it.
                    Watermelon is around 90% water, which can keep me hydrated during the hot weather.
                    However, you would be consuming a lot of sugar if you eat too much watermelon.
                    My mom usually cuts the watermelon in half and scoop over it watching TV show. 
                    I will approach her to see if I can luckily get a chance to drink the juice.
                    Sometimes she would put some into my little bowl, but most of the time she keeps
                    it to herself and let me sit watching her eat.
